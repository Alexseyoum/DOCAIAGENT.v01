# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It has revolutionized many fields including healthcare, finance, and technology.

## Key Concepts

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. **Neural Networks**: Models inspired by the human brain
4. **Deep Learning**: Multi-layered neural networks

## Applications

- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles

## Conclusion

Machine learning continues to advance rapidly, with new techniques and applications emerging constantly.
